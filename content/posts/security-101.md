## passwords and 2fa

- passwords should be at least 16 chars long
- use multiple words that don't make sense together
- do not use known quotes, sentences, lyrics, etc
- never reuse a password
- best way to generate passwords is through a password manager (like keypassxc)
- passwords should not contain or follow patterns (asdf1234, qwertyuiop, 13579adgjl)
- never test your password "stregth" on online services
- use a passwords manager
- check haveibeenpwned to check for leaks (change passwords, and if you used that one on any other service, change it too)
- always use 2FA 
- do not use password hints, if its mandatory: fill them with random data
- do not use browser password administrator

## password managers (or keypassxc)

the idea is just to remember a master password. Then, the password manager will do all the work left for you.

## hard drive encryption

encrypt your hard drive with a passphrase of at least 5 words (more than 20 chars)

- windows users: link
- mac users: link
- linux: DYOR... but link

## lockscreen

always lock your computer whenever you stop using your pc/laptop. Try to set up automatic lock on idle/sleep

## updates

- linux: i mean, don't be a bleeding edge arch fat user if you want best security... just use a stable release and update your packages every once in a while.
- windows: idk do what your heart and bill gates says
- mac: same as windows but with steve jobs i guess

## file encryption 

use gpg or veracrypt
